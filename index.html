        <h2>About the App</h2>

        <p>The Cue Pin Select App is a simple password manager that generates passwords for services using a secret PIN, a secret passphrase, and a 4 letter cue specific to each service.  Unlike with most password managers, the passwords can be quickly derived by hand if needed.  The scheme will generate strong passwords that meet most common password requirements.  Passwords are never stored, but instead are derived when needed from the stored secret PIN and passphrase.  The app supports Face ID for quick access after initial setup.</p>

        <h2>Password Scheme</h2>

        <p>The password scheme is a variation of the Cue Pin Select password scheme described here: <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01781231/file/Cue_Pin_Select__a_Secure_and_Usable_Offline_Password_Scheme%20%286%29.pdf">Cue Pin Select paper</a></p>
